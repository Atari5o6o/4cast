## Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock price movements based on historical OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) data. It utilizes an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) Classifier and retrieves stock data from the Yahoo Finance API. The aim is to build a model that can forecast stock open price on a given day.

## Features

- **MLP Classifier:** Utilizes an MLP Classifier to analyze historical OHLC data and predict stock price.

- **Yahoo Finance API Integration:** Gathers historical stock data, including OHLC prices and volume, from Yahoo Finance.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the data for model training, including feature engineering and normalization.

- **Model Training:** Trains the MLP Classifier on the preprocessed data to learn patterns and trends in stock price movements.

- **Price Movement Forecasting:** Generates predictions for stock price movements, such as whether the price will increase or decrease, and stock opem price on any given day.
